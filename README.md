# PostgreSQL-challenge
This is a dataset about a fictional company, Pewlett Hackard. Using the app at https://app.genmymodel.com/editor/edit/_w042UHPAEeuCM8KqVoRWiA# I built an ERD, exported as a PNG.

After setting up this database relationship, I used this to create the schema for PostgreSQL, contained in schema.sql.

The data and queries used to obtain that information is in query.sql.

After that analysis, further reporting is done in Jupyter Notebooks. That information is in dont_give_me_fake_data.ipynb.   

Information to use the engine and login to a local SQL server is contained in config.py.
